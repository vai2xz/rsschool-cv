## BIOGRAPHY
As a consultant, researcher, analyst, and business modeler I specialize in computer simulation and data analytics. Over the years I have successfully held several positions such as System Dynamics Consultant, Computer Simulation Specialist, System Dynamics Analyst, IT Specialist, Teaching Assistant in several countries across Europe: in UK, Italy, Belgium, Norway, Finland, and Lithuania. I am a rapid learner with strong analytical, quantitative, communication, facilitation, and IT skills. As a system dynamicist, I am uniquely qualified to sift through large quantities of data, draw conclusions, design computer simulation models, and use them to analyze business strategies and operations, develop improved business policies, and help policy implementation processes. I had the opportunity to apply my skills in a variety of industries: energy, fast-moving consumer goods, aircraft manufacturing, high technology manufacturing, and software development.
